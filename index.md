## Welcome to Witchcraft Code

Here we will help the villagers to get nice witch programs based on php

### code blocks

# main
 1. input from user
 2. calculate function call
 3. display the result
 
# library
 1. KillAverage function => calculate average rate
 2. KillSpell function => calculate  kill of the year
 3. Mantra  function => inner loop calculation


### Rule

The witch ...
On the 1st year she kills 1 villager
On the 2nd year she kills 1 + 1 = 2 villagers
On the 3rd year she kills 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 villagers
On the 4th year she kills 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 villagers
On the 5th year she kills 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12 villagers
And so on..


If given two people whose age of death and year of death are known, find the average number of people the witch killed on year of birth of those people
Example:
Given:Person A: Age of death = 10, Year of Death = 12
Person B: Age of death = 13, Year of Death = 17
Answer:Person A born on Year = 12 –10 = 2, number of people killed on year 2 is 2.
Person B born on Year = 17 –13 = 4, number of people killed on year 4 is 7.
So the average is ( 7 + 2 )/2 = 4.5
If you giveinvalid data (i.e. negative age, person who born before the witch took control) the program should return -1

###
How to run :
 - deploy to web server
 - input all input
 - view the result
